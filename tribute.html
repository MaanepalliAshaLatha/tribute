    <div class="second">
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; fill: aliceblue;">
    <li>Take risks in your life, If you win, you can lead! If you loose, you can guide!</li>
    <li>Experience is the only teacher we have. we may talk and reason all our lives, but we shall not understand a word of truth.</li>
    <li>Take up one idea, make that one idea your life. Think of it, dream of it, Live on that idea let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.</li>
    <li>Stand up, be bold, and take the blame on your own shoulders. Do not go about throwing mud at other; for all the faults you suffer from, you are the sole and only cause.</li>
    <li>Meditation can turn fools in to sages but unfortunately fools never meditate.</li>
    <li>Learn everything that is good from others, but bring it in, and in your own way adsorb it; do not become others.</li>
    <li>Whatever you believe, that you will be, If you believe yourselves to be ages, ages you will be tomorrow. There is nothing to obstruct you.</li>
    <li>If i love myself despite my infinite faults, how can i hate anyone at the glimpse of a few faults</li>
    <li>All power is within you. You can do anything and everything. Believe in that. Do not believe that you are weak; do ot believe that you are half-crazy lunatics, as most of us do nowadays. Stand up and express the divinity within you.</li>
    <li>Talk to yourself once in a day.. otherwise you may miss meeting an excellent person in this world.</li>
    <li>he mistake is that we want to tie the whole world down to our own plane of thought and to make out mind the measure of the whole universe.</li>
    <li>We are what our thought have made us; So take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; They travel far.</li>
